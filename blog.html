    <p>First Day of App Academy</p>

    <p>
      Today was the first day on my new coding path, App Academy!

      From what I've read, it appears to be a very reputable bootcamp that also
      has a <a href="https://open.appacademy.io/">free curriculum</a> online!

      I've worked up through the Arrays section in Intro to Programming as of
      the end of today. I love the format! Watch an explanation, do some reading
      and then put it to use. Today was pretty much just getting used to Ruby's
      syntax. It seems very similar to Python, with a few differences here and
      there.

      Anyway, it's late so I'd better hit the sack. I'll update with more news
      on my studies tomorrow!
